                             <p>In imperial China, tattoos weren't chosen, but rather assigned as punishment. Known as "ci pei," criminals were forcibly inked with characters detailing their crimes, marking them as social outcasts for life. While some communities preserved tattooing as a form of tradition, the dominant association became one of shame and criminality.</p>

                            <p>Beneath the surface of vibrant ink lies a history of fear and moral judgment.
